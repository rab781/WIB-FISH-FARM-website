- Implemented proper caching mechanism to reduce API calls
- Added a 3-second timeout for the RajaOngkir API calls
- Created robust fallback mechanisms when the API is slow or fails
- Enhanced response data to include detailed box information
- Ensured TIKI is the required courier for fish shipping

### 2. Improved Checkout UI
- Added pre-rendered TIKI shipping option that shows immediately
- Displayed default shipping cost (50,000 Rp) while waiting for API
- Added detailed box descriptions with dimensions and handling instructions
- Improved visualization of shipping requirements
- Added meaningful status indicators during loading

### 3. Enhanced Box Information Display
- Created visual indicators for box information
- Added detailed breakdown of the number of boxes needed based on fish count
- Provided clear information about box dimensions (40x40x40 cm)
- Added information about box capacity (3 fish per box)
- Included weight information (10kg per box)

### 4. Ensured TIKI Courier Enforcement
- Added validation to ensure only TIKI courier can be selected
- Added warning messages about fish shipping requirements
- Created visual indicators to highlight the TIKI requirement

## Technical Implementation Details

### Caching Strategy
- Cache key: `ongkir_{alamatId}_{selected_items}`
- Cache duration: 30 minutes for successful API responses, 15 minutes for fallbacks
- Immediate response from cache when available

### API Response Handling

- Structured fallback mechanism with default values
- Detailed response including box information, weight, and shipping recommendations

### UI Enhancements
- Immediate display of shipping options
- Detailed box information with icons and formatting
- Visual indicators for important shipping requirements
- Responsive design that works well on mobile and desktop

## Testing the Implementation

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Add fish products to the cart
2. Proceed to checkout
3. Verify that shipping information appears immediately
4. Check that the box information is displayed correctly
5. Confirm that only TIKI shipping options are available
6. Complete the checkout process
7. Verify that the order summary shows correct shipping details

### Expected Results
- Shipping information appears immediately, no noticeable loading delay
- Detailed box information is shown, including number of boxes and capacity
- TIKI is the only available courier option
- The total includes the correct shipping cost
- Box information is clearly visible and understandable

## Monitoring Recommendations
- Monitor API response times to ensure the timeout is appropriate
- Track cache hit rates to optimize caching strategy
- Monitor customer feedback about the checkout process
